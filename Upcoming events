            DevOps is a software development methodology that emphasizes collaboration, communication, automation, and integration between software development and IT operations teams. The primary goal of DevOps is to shorten the software development lifecycle, increase the frequency of software releases, and improve the quality and reliability of software delivery.
            
            Cloud computing involves the delivery of computing services—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics—over the internet (the cloud). Instead of owning and maintaining physical hardware and infrastructure, organizations can access these services on-demand from cloud service providers.</p>
